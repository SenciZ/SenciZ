### I'm a Full Stack Developer, who loves learning the endless technologies that Tech has to offer and collaborating with like-minded developers!

Iâ€™m currently focusing on JavaScript, React.js, and Backend technologies. Within the next 4 months, I hope to create several applications to showcase on my portfolio in order to show potential employers my current skills. In the next year, I aim to be employed within the field working alongside senior developers to learn from them while also utilizing my unique skills and background to help them innovate and produce a better product for their clients. My 5-year goal involves me becoming extremely versed in my current stack of PostgreSQL, Express, React.js, and Node.js while also learning other tech such as Vue.js, Angular, MongoDB, C# with .NET and iOS to name a few. While on my way to my 5-year goal I intend to mentor incoming devs to help them along in their path just as others might have done for me.
